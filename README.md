# Q-AEGIS v4 • Quantum Hypertime Nuclear-Threat Scanner  
*A guardian-class, lore-rich AI defence core*  

---

## 🚀 Overview
Q-AEGIS (“Quantum-Aegis”) is a self-contained Python system that

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **BioVector 25** | Samples a 25-dimensional biometric vector encoding local stress, coherence and population intensity |
| **Quantum Metric** | Runs a 7-qubit PennyLane circuit (`q_intensity`) to transform the BioVector into a coherence score (`θ`, `q_score`) |
| **Stage 1 Prompt** | Ultra-longform narrative prompt that classifies the zone as **GREEN / AMBER / RED** |
| **Stage 2 Prompt** | Generates upper-case tactical actions (drones, interceptors, evacuation) + cooldown |
| **Stage 3 Prompt** | Crafts a single, poetic civilian broadcast ≤ 400 chars |
| **Stage 4 Prompt** | Outputs 2-3 long-term 96 h planetary advisories |
| **LDS / Grid** | Launches C-RAM, Iron Dome and 24 scramble drones; logs hit/miss probabilities |
| **Scheduler** | APScheduler loop (default: every 60 min) → JSON log per run |

All prompts are *ultra-longform narrative mode*, embedding lore, ethics and hypertime foresight.

## ⚙️ Quick Start
```bash
# 1 – Clone & enter
git clone https://github.com/your-org/q-aegis.git
cd q-aegis

# 2 – Install deps
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# requirements.txt: numpy geopy apscheduler pennylane openai tqdm

# 3 – Set your OpenAI key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# 4 – Run
python q_aegis.py
```
Hourly JSON reports appear as `q_report_<epoch>.json`.

## 🔍 File Structure
```
q_aegis.py        ← single-file core (all prompts + logic)
requirements.txt  ← minimal dependency list
README.md         ← you’re here
reports/          ← auto-generated JSON logs
```

## 🧠 Prompt Cascade

| Stage | Approx. Tokens | Highlight |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| **1 – Risk Tier** | ~350 | Multiversal origin, nuclear entropy |
| **2 – Tactics**  | ~300 | 14 000 hypertime branches, compassion |
| **3 – Broadcast**| ~250 | Dignity & calm ≤ 400 chars |
| **4 – Advisory** | ~300 | 96-h foresight, “rebuild / decentralize / trust” |

## 🛡 System Tuning

| Variable | Location | Default | Effect |
|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| `INTERVAL_MIN` | top of `q_aegis.py` | 60 | minutes between scans |
| `MODEL` | top | `gpt-4o` | LLM model |
| Drone count | `Grid(n=24)` | 24 | scramble capacity |
| Asset stock | `LDS.pool` | 16 C-RAM / 12 Iron Dome | arsenal limits |

---

## 🌍 Extending
* **Stage 5 – Diplomatic Outreach** Draft letters to heads of state.  
* **GUI Dashboard** Wrap `scan_once()` in Flask or KivyMD.  
* **Cloud Logs** Push JSON to S3 / IPFS.  
* **Voice Synth** Pipe Stage 3 through TTS for public sirens.

# Letter to President Donald J. Trump  
**From:** Graylan  
**Subject:** This Must Never Happen Again — For the Sake of All Nations  

Dear President Trump,

I’m writing to you with a deep sense of urgency and clarity. Whatever just happened — whatever *almost* unfolded between nations like the U.S., Iran, and Israel — must **never, ever, ever** happen again.

Something aligned in my life that pulled me out of a very dark place — a psych ward — and somehow that moment may have helped tune timelines or at least stopped one that could’ve destroyed lives, economies, and trust on a global scale. Call it divine intervention, Hypertime correction, or just blind luck — but it was **too close**. And I believe with every fiber of my being that the next time we may not get so lucky.

If we don’t act now to **prevent this from repeating**, we risk two full years of geopolitical chaos, economic paralysis, and irreversible loss of civilian life. The very foundation of prosperity — trust, trade, and mutual respect — would collapse not just between nations, but within our communities.

I’m not asking for sympathy — I’m asking for **strategic foresight**.  
Use what I’ve built, or let me help improve it. The **Quantum Nuclear Threat Scanner** project I’m working on can run predictive scenarios and help **guide our responses with empathy, not entropy**.

Let’s be thankful that this didn’t end in fire.

And as for me — I’m staying clean.  
**I am drug free. I will stay drug free.** I will keep building. I will keep defending.

Thank you for everything you've done and are still doing to protect this nation.  
But now it's time to protect the whole timeline.

With resolve,  
**Graylan**  
*Quantum AI Developer | Clean & Vigilant*
